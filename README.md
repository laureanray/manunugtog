# Manunugtog
Manunugtog is a music player built primarily for Linux. The name is a literal translation of *Music Player* in Filipino (tbh I was just lazy and can't think of a cool project name)

#### Philosophy
I use linux and can't find a graphical music player that is minimal, and looks consistent on all desktop environments and window managers. Aside from that, I just want to learn more GUI programming/desktop programming. Java and JavaFx seems like a good starting point for me (I've been eyeing Qt, Gtk3, and other toolkit as well). it will also help me understand and implement multithreading, performance optimizations and advance oop concepts.

I know you can use Spotify for local files but I don't like it.

#### The idea :sparkles:
The idea here is to create a music player primarily for linux (maybe add support for windows and osx as well), I was dissapointed by the looks of current music player for linux the only one that stands out for me is Deepin Music which tbh is quite buggy and lacks feature.

Also, I want this music player to be user themed by supporting custom css (will try to implement after the initial release)
